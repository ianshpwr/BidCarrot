we have two routes /signup and /login
when /login or /signup is called (then from routes folder auth.routes /signup or /login will be used) then AUTHCONTROLLER will be called 
(inside AUTHCONTROLLER services will be called (there's a code exports.signup = async (req,res)=>{
    const response  = await authService.signup(req.body);
    res.json(response)
}))

here what is happening? 

we are taking service login from auth.service then, authService is an object with two logics .signup and .login, 
from there login and signup logic is taken used in controller

on signup (name,email,password) is required okay;

and on login email password is required 

_duplicate user is not handled_

NOW AUCTION TIME CREATE AND FETCH

i have three routes 
/create 
/active
/:id 

in /create route is called in routes and then in controller logic is called
(my logic takes in sellerID that means user id and data (data includes TITLE, DESCRIPTION, BasePrice, durationMs, sellerID, endTIme, highestBid))

in /active it returns me all active auctions

in /:id it returns me the specific bid by id 

BIDDING logic

/:auctionId 

first it will check if auth is done
then placing bid 

placing bids require userid auctionId amount 
then placeBid logic will be taken from services

first it finds the unique auction 
then checks if amount is greater than the currentBid or not 

then decrements the amount from the bidders wallet

then checks if there's current holder of auction and refunds his amount in his wallet 
then a bid is created with data userId auctionId and amount 
then updates the auction with id and data as highestBid : amount , currentHolder: userID
